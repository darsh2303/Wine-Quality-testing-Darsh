### Data Description

 

 - The dataset contains chemical descriptions of 4899 Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wines.
 - There are 4899 entries for various input variables.
 - The source of the data is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, provided by Paulo Cortez, from the University of Minho, Portugal.
 - Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
	 - fixed acidity
	 -  volatile acidity
	 -  citric acid
	 -  residual sugar
	 - chlorides
	 - free sulfur dioxide
	 - total sulfur dioxide
	 - density
	 - pH
	 - sulphates
	 - alcohol
	 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
